    <h1>🎓 NHQEF Graduate Attributes & Course Learning Outcomes: A Practical Quick Guide</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>🔍 What Are NHQEF Graduate Attributes?</h2>
      <p>Graduate Attributes are the qualities—knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes—that students are expected to develop by the time they graduate.</p>
      <p><strong>They answer:</strong> “What kind of person should our graduates become?”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📘 What Are Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)?</h2>
      <p>CLOs describe what a student should be able to do at the end of a course.</p>
      <p><strong>They answer:</strong> “What will students learn and be able to demonstrate after this course?”</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>📌 Observations & Critical Reflections</h2>
      <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> NHQEF emphasizes cognitive development, but also holistic development (affective, ethical, societal dimensions). Some student outcomes (e.g., confidence, beliefs) may be difficult to observe or assess but are equally important.</p>
        <p>Inputs to student learning go beyond courses—resources, teacher support, and inclusive practices matter.</p>

      <h2>🌐 Broad Idea of GA and CLOs</h2>
      <p><em>Note: This model includes student contributions and subject evolution.</em></p>
      <p>A picture for GAs similar to the one below:</p>
      <img src="graduate-attributes.png" alt="Graduate Attributes Diagram" class="diagram">
      <p><strong>GAs are</strong> for programs such as BSc (Mathematics) Hons., BA (Physics), etc.</p>
      <p>For example, the GAs for a BSc (Mathematics) Hons program could be as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apply analytical thinking to solve theoretical and real-world problems.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate deep understanding of core mathematical areas.</li>
        <li>Use software and programming tools for modeling and analysis.</li>
        <li>Present mathematical ideas clearly in oral and written forms.</li>
        <li>Pose questions, explore patterns, and engage in mathematical investigations.</li>
      </ul>
